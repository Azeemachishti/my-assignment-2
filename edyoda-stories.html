                    <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;|23 aug 2019</p>
                    <p class="para">We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of its subfields is machine learning
                         and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course holds.
                         To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically,
                          it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a data
                         and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize.</p>

                    <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;|14 oct 2019</p>
                    <p class="para">The term Income Share Agreement has been around for a long time since 1955 to be precise. Surprised, eh? It was first introduced by Milton Friedman, an American economist, and statistician who strongly believed in “free-market capitalism”. In the last few months, there has been a lot of buzz around it, particularly among college graduates.</p>

                    <p class="para">Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to “learn” (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) from data, without being explicitly programmed. Think of how efficiently (or not) Gmail detects spam emails, or how good text-to-speech has become with the rise of Siri, Alexa, and Google Home.</p>

                    <p><span>EdYoda</span>&nbsp;|24 Aug 2019</p>
                    <p class="para">Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is an important part of computer science. The revolution of Big Data promises to transform the way we work, live and think by enabling the process of optimization, discovering insights and improved decision making. This potential relies on the ability to extract value from big data and provide data analytics. </p>
